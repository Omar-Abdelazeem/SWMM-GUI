## Introduction

This is the official SWMM Windows GUI source code repository maintained by US EPA Office of Research and Development, Center For Environmental Solutions & Emergency Response, Water Infrastructure Division located in Cincinnati, Ohio. The interface was written using Embarcadero's Delphi
10.4 (www.embarcadero.com). The name of the Delphi project containing
the code is Epaswmm5. All of the files for the project can be found
in the Epaswmm5 folder within this archive.

Before the Epaswmm5 project can be loaded into Delphi's Integrated
Development Environment (IDE), several special components must be
installed into the IDE's component pallette. The source code for
these components is contained in the Components folder in this
archive. Consult the Installation.txt file in that folder for
instructions on how to install these components.

SWMM is a dynamic hydrology-hydraulic water quality simulation model. It is used for single event or long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas. SWMM source code is written in the C Programming Language and released in the Public Domain.
